            <h5>Branches</h5>
            <br>
            -Branches in Git allows us to develop new features or add new features to the existing code , correct
            any errors and to safely carry out experimental work on our repository.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Helps us separate the new development work without affecting other branches.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Branches are used to keep the master/base branch working and clean of errors.
            </br>
            <br>
            -“git checkout -b” command is used to create new branches
            </br>
            <br>
            -Branches can be created from existing branches
            </br>
            <br>
            -Once the changes in a branch are tested and ready to be deployed , then a pull request is opened to merge
            changes into the base/master branch.
            </br>
            <br>
            -After a pull request has been merged, or closed, you can delete the head branch as this is no longer
            needed.
            </br>
            <br>
            -When there is an open pull request then that branch cannot be deleted.
            </br>
            <br>
            -We can have branches that are protected. Delete or force push to the branch on such branches cannot be done
            if you are not the repository administrator.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Repository administrator can also be added to follow the rules on protected branches.
            </br>
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Merge</h5>
            <br>
            -Git merge combines sequences of commits into one single history of commits.
            </br>
            <br>
            -In most cases, git merge is used to combine two branches
            </br>
            <br>
            -We can use git checkout to switch to the branch we want to merge into , when we need to combine
            branches locally. This branch is typically the master/main branch.
            </br>
            <br>
            -We can use git merge and specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Merge Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the
            current branch) into the current branch.
            </br>
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Commit</h5>
            <br>
            -Used to record the changes made to a repository.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Can be viewed as snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought
            of as safe versions of a project.
            </br>
            <br>
            -By using git add command we can specify the content to be committed
            </br>
            <br>
            -The -m option is used to specify a message for the commit.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Once the changes are committed , they can be pushed to the remote repository from local repository.
            </br>

            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Tags</h5>
            <br>
            -Tags are used to mark a particular in a repository’s history as important.
            </br>
            <br>
            -They are be used to mark different versions of the same product.
            </br>
            <br>
            -git tag lists all the tags of the repository.
            </br>
            <br>
            -There are 2 types of tags light weight and annotated.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Annotated tags store complete information like name, email of the tagger , date , checksum etc.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Lightweight tags only store the checksum and are usually used as temporary tag.
            </br>

            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Repository</h5>
            <br>
            -A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project. It
            saves this data in a directory called . git , also known as the repository folder. Git uses a version
            control system to track all changes made to the project and save them in the repository.
            </br>
            <br>
            -Git repository can be created by either cloning an existing git repo from elsewhere or by taking a
            local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository.
            </br>

                    <p class="card-text">Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and
                        open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git
                        is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on
                        non-linear development.</p>
